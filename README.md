# DiscordBot

## Introduction

Hi and welcome,
Here's an attempt to create a bot for Discord which would do some funny stuff

All in nodeJs

## Prerequisites :

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Discord account.
- A Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   `bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DiscordBot.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

`bash cd DiscordBot`

3. **Install the dependencies:**

`bash npm install`

4. **Configure the bot:**

Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add your Discord bot token to the .env file:

`javascript DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here`

## Usage

Run the bot with the following command:
`bash node index.js`

The bot should now be online and ready to use in your Discord server.
